            <p> My main goal in life is to never stop learning. I'm a December 2017 graduate of the Univeristy of Texas at Austin with a B.A. in Latin Language and a minor in Chemistry with coursework spanning from molecular modeling on super computers to writing entire papers about a single Latin word. Now I'm aiming to create dynamic websites and fullstack apps to make the world more efficient. I'm currently taking the fullstack development bootcamp course through UT Austin, so I will continue to add projects to this site as I learn. This profile is under constant construction, and I hope that you'll stick with me to watch it grow.
            </p>
            
            <p>I'm a Texas native, born and raised in Houston. I love playing videogames, hanging out with my two cats, crocheting purses, and collecting plants. I frequently volunteer in Austin at the Inside Books Project, an organization that sends books to Texas inmates. I'm using a combination of apps to try to learn Japanese, and my current goal with web development is to create (or help create) a one-stop-shop for online language learning that combines rote memorization of vocabularly with an extensive grammar handbook.
